# Cryptocurrency ePaper Ticker 
(supports all 7000+ coins/currencies listed on [CoinGecko](https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/list))

An ePaper Cryptocurrency price ticker that runs as a Python script on a Raspberry Pi connected to a [Waveshare 2.7 inch monochrome ePaper display](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2.7inch_e-Paper_HAT). The script periodically (every 5 mins by default) takes data from CoinGecko and prints a summary to the ePaper.

A few minutes work gives you a desk ornament that will tastefully and unobtrusively monitor a coin's journey moonward.

# Getting started

## Prerequisites

(These instructions assume that your Raspberry Pi is already connected to the Internet, happily running `pip` and has `python3` installed)

If you are running the Pi headless, connect to your Raspberry Pi using `ssh`.

Connect to your ticker over ssh and update and install necessary packages 
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip mc git libopenjp2-7
sudo apt-get install -y libatlas-base-dev python3-pil
```

Enable spi (0=on 1=off)

```
sudo raspi-config nonint do_spi 0
```

Now clone the required software (Waveshare libraries and this script)

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/waveshare/e-Paper
git clone https://github.com/llvllch/btcticker.git
cd btcticker
cp config_example.yaml config.yaml
cp -r /home/pi/e-Paper/RaspberryPi_JetsonNano/python/lib/waveshare_epd .
rm -rf /home/pi/e-Paper
```
Install the required Python3 modules
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Add Autostart

```
sudo cat <<EOF > /etc/systemd/system/btcticker.service
[Unit]
Description=btcticker
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 -u /home/pi/btcticker/btcticker.py
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/btcticker/
StandardOutput=inherit
StandardError=inherit
Restart=always
User=pi

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```
Now, simply enable the service you just made and reboot
```  
sudo systemctl enable btcticker.service
sudo systemctl start btcticker.service

reboot
```
# Interface

The ePaper is slow. There is a lag of a few seconds between button press and a change to the display. 

Here's what the buttons do:
- Button 1: Cycle through the cryptocurrencies listed in config.yaml
- Button 2: Rotate Display -90 degrees
- Button 3: Invert Display
- Button 4: Cycle through the fiat currencies listed in config.yaml

Update frequency can be changed in the configuration file (default is 300 seconds).

# Configuration

The file `config.yaml` contains a number of options that may be tweaked:

```
display:
  cycle: true
  inverted: false
  orientation: 90
  trendingmode: false
  showvolume: false
  showrank: false
ticker:
  currency: bitcoin,ethereum,cardano
  exchange: default
  fiatcurrency: usd,eur,gbp
  sparklinedays: 1 
  updatefrequency: 300
```

## Values

- **cycle**: switch the display between the listed currencies if set to **true**, display only the first on the list if set to **false**
- **inverted**: Black text on grey background if **false**. Grey text on black background if **true**
- **orientation**: Screen rotation in degrees , can take values **0,90,180,270**
- **trendingmode**: If **true**, it checks the 7 coins that coingecko lists as trending and also displays them (names are included in display)
- **showvolume, showrank**: **true** to include in display, **false** to omit
- **currency**: the coin(s) you would like to display (must be the coingecko id)
- **exchange**: default means use coingecko price, it can also be set to a specific exchange name such as **gdax** (coinbase), **binance** or **kraken** (full list on coingecko api [page](https://www.coingecko.com/api/documentations/v3)) 
- **fiatcurrency**: currently only uses first one (unless you are cycling with buttons)
- **sparklinedays**: Number of days of historical data appearing on chart
- **updatefrequency**: (in seconds), how often to refresh the display

## Trending mode

When you activate trending mode (by setting to true in the config file, in addition to your coins, the ticker will cycle through 7 coins that are currently listing as trending on CoinGecko (see photo below).
